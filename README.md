### How to contribute with a tutorial?

After having cloned this repo and opened a proper branch, you can write down your 
tutorial with in the form of an `*.ipynb` file.

In order to upload lighter notebooks we propose a modification to the `config` file
of `git`. Please paste and copy the contents of the file [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/qiboteam/tutorials/blob/clear_notebooks_output/.gitconfig) 
into your `.git/config` file.

This will clean all your notebook's output when you make a `push`.
